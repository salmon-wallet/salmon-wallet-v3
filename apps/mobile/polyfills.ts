 * Crypto Polyfills for React Native

 * @deprecated This file is no longer the primary polyfill location.
 * Polyfills are now loaded in index.js (the app entry point) to ensure
 * they are available BEFORE expo-router loads any modules.
 *
 * This file is kept for backwards compatibility with test files and
 * other parts of the codebase that may still import it.
 *
 * Required for: @solana/web3.js, bitcoinjs-lib, and other crypto libraries
