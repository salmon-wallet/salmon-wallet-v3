description: "Resolve code placement, package ownership, shared-vs-app boundaries, public exports, and architectural conventions in the Salmon Wallet monorepo. Use this skill whenever a task could change where code lives, which package owns it, whether a contract belongs in packages/shared, whether UI belongs in packages/ui or apps/mobile, or how barrels and theme tokens should be handled. Use it together with the authoring and testing skills whenever structure or ownership could change."

The canonical placement and ownership ruleset for the Salmon Wallet monorepo. Load the relevant reference, inspect existing code, then act.

## Mandatory stance

- Prefer existing repo patterns over inventing new ones.
- Search before creating new files, hooks, types, or components.
- Ask clarifying questions when architecture, ownership, or behavior is ambiguous.
- Use this skill alongside specialized authoring or testing skills whenever structure or public exports may change.

## Clarification gate

Before making a change, stop and ask 1-3 focused questions if any of these are unclear:

- Is this code truly shared across `mobile`, `web`, and `extension`?
- Does it belong in `packages/ui` or in an app-specific directory?
- Is the type semantic and cross-platform, or only visual/platform-specific?
- Does a dependency (browser API, React Native API, biometrics, navigation) make it platform-only?
- Does the change alter a public export path, barrel, or contract?
- Is the code in the middle of an in-flight refactor?
- Does mobile also need this component or flow?
- Is part of the logic a service, util, or mapper rather than hook/component logic?
- Does something equivalent already exist in the repo?

If the answer could change code placement, API shape, or test scope, ask first.

## Core rules

- `packages/shared` — only code shared by `mobile`, `web`, and `extension`.
- `packages/ui` — only React DOM components shared by `web` and `extension`.
- `apps/mobile` — React Native components, native integrations, and mobile-only UI flows.
- Platform-only code stays in its app.
- `packages/shared/src/theme` is the single source of design tokens.
- External consumers prefer `@salmon/shared`. Inside `packages/shared`, use relative imports.
- Public barrels expose named exports only.
- Hooks over 300 lines and components over 250-300 lines are split candidates.

## Route to the right reference

Pick the reference that matches the task:

| Task | Reference |
|---|---|
| Deciding where code lives | [references/placement-matrix.md](references/placement-matrix.md) |
| Creating or editing shared hooks | [references/hook-rules.md](references/hook-rules.md) |
| Creating or editing shared DOM components | [references/component-rules.md](references/component-rules.md) |
| Creating or editing React Native components in `apps/mobile` | [references/mobile-rules.md](references/mobile-rules.md) |
| Creating or editing cross-platform UI contracts | [references/contract-rules.md](references/contract-rules.md) |

Read the relevant reference before making changes. Check `openspec/config.yaml` and relevant specs when the work touches architecture or established capabilities.

## Companion skills

- Use `ui-component-scaffold` for `packages/ui` implementation work.
- Use `ui-test-authoring` for `packages/ui` test work.
- Use `mobile-component-scaffold` for `apps/mobile` component work.
- Use `mobile-test-authoring` for `apps/mobile` test work.
- Use `shared-test-authoring` for `@salmon/shared` tests.
- Use `api-service-authoring` for shared API services.

## Audit mode

When asked to audit the repo structure, check for:

- Code in `packages/shared` that is only used by one platform (should be app-local)
- Code in `packages/ui` that contains business logic (should be in shared or app)
- Hooks in `packages/shared` that depend on browser or React Native APIs (platform leak)
- Default exports in public barrels (should be named exports only)
- Domain types duplicated across multiple locations instead of having one canonical home
- Components over 250-300 lines or hooks over 300 lines that haven't been split
- Barrel exports that are out of sync with actual module exports
- Hardcoded design values (colors, spacing, font sizes) instead of theme tokens
- Import paths using `@salmon/ui` from mobile (not allowed)
- Types in `packages/shared/src/types/ui/` that only reference DOM-specific concerns
- React Native components that duplicate shared semantic contracts instead of extending them
- Mobile-only components incorrectly pushed into `packages/shared` or `packages/ui`

Report findings as a prioritized list with file paths and specific violations.

## What this skill should produce

- A concrete statement of which rules apply to the task.
- A clear placement recommendation with reasoning.
- An audit report when asked to review repo structure or conventions.
- Clarifying questions first when ownership is ambiguous.
